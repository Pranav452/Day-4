## Detailed Analysis


### Base Models

#### gpt2-small
**Description:** Original GPT-2 base model - raw text completion

**Full Response:**
```
.

$ bubble sort --sort-by-binary-name

The bubble sort algorithm is a simple, very simple version of the BubbleSort, which does the following:

Sort a list by binary names using the binary-name sort algorithm.

Sort the list with binary names.

Clear all the binary names in the list.

Sort the list with binary names.

Sort the list with binary names.

Bubble sort is available in Python 3, Python 2.7, and Python 3.6.

How to use Bubble Sort:

Basic usage

$ bubble sort --sort-by-binary-
```

**Performance:** 3.97 seconds

#### distilgpt2
**Description:** Smaller, faster version of GPT-2

**Full Response:**
```
.








To be clear, this project is very much the same project as the last. This project is a Python program. It uses Python for the sorting of sorted items.
First of all, it is a python based version of Python. This is the first Python program that utilizes the Python function.
In order to create the list, we need to use the 'sorted' to sort a list using bubble sort algorithm.
First, we need to create the list using the 'sorted' to sort a list using bubble sort algorithm.

```

**Performance:** 1.61 seconds


### Instruct Models

#### dialogpt-small
**Description:** Conversational model trained for dialog (your familiar model)

**Full Response:**
```
. I don't feel like I am a mathematician.
```

**Performance:** 0.34 seconds

#### gpt2-medium
**Description:** Larger GPT-2 model with better instruction following

**Full Response:**
```
using the provided data.

Example:

import pandas as pd import pandas.contrib.pandas as pd from time import sleep data = { 'time' : '2014-01-20T12:32:58.972Z' } sorted_list = pd.DataFrame(data = sorted_list) for row in sorted_list: print (row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3], row[4], row[5], row[6], row[7], row[8])

Sets the default sort order of the data, if any. Default sort order
```

**Performance:** 5.22 seconds


### Fine-Tuned Models

#### gpt2-large
**Description:** Larger GPT-2 model - shows scaling effects

**Full Response:**
```
.

The function will return the sorted list.

#import the module import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #print the algorithm function print ( bubble_sort ( list , n = 1000000 )) print ( list [ 0 ])

This will print the list sorted in ascending order.

Now you can write a function that will sort a list of numbers using bubble sort algorithm.

#import the module import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def bubble_sort ( list , n = 1000000 ): """return list sorted in ascending order""" if n > 0 : return list [ 0
```

**Performance:** 8.12 seconds



## Key Observations

- Base models provide raw text completion
- Instruct models are better at following instructions
- Fine-tuned models excel in specialized domains
- All models are free and run locally
- **Performance:** dialogpt-small was the fastest, generating response in 0.34s
- **Base models:** May provide less structured responses as they're optimized for text completion rather than instruction following
- **Instruct models:** Generally provide more coherent and instruction-aware responses
- **Fine-tuned models:** Show specialized knowledge in their domain but may be less versatile for general queries
- **Cost:** All models used are completely free and run locally using HuggingFace transformers
