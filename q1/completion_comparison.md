## Detailed Analysis


### Base Models

#### gpt2-small
**Description:** Original GPT-2 base model - raw text completion

**Full Response:**
```
fence and lets fly with one arm to avoid the guards and his other. The fox's body is covered in a white mist. He is also covered in black and black eyes. After he has escaped, when he comes to the courtyard, the guards are looking at him with a smile on their faces. "What's the matter? You have to be in a hurry."

"What? Wait a minute. Are you sure? I did not say that." The fox quickly steps into the courtyard and tries to flee.

"Come on, I'm not doing anything wrong, so don't be afraid to catch me before I'm gone!"

"Don't worry, we can catch you

white fox on top of it. The fox is covered in a white fox's coat and then a small bluish-green bluish-green grey. The fox starts to kick and then it's ready to get out of the fox's coat. It's about as if the fox was taking a hit when it hit and the fox is running around before it gets out of the fox's coat. The fox is then ready to get out of the fox's coat and then it's ready to go off.

The fox is then left to chase after a small black fox. The fox then looks at the fox and tries to chase it off. The fox is then left to chase after a white fox.
```

**Performance:** 1.64 seconds


### Instruct Models

#### dialogpt-small
**Description:** Conversational model trained for dialog (your familiar model)

**Full Response:**
```
lazy dog?
```

**Performance:** 0.19 seconds

#### gpt2-medium
**Description:** Larger GPT-2 model with better instruction following

**Full Response:**
```
lazy dog," wrote a commenter on Reddit. "I wonder if the quick brown fox will jump over the lazy dog if he wants to."

"I'm going to be honest with you, it's more complicated than that," said Matt Jansen, a social media director for the Washington, D.C.-based National Association of Secretaries of State.

Many of the questions about the Trump campaign's interactions with Russia stem from news reports during the 2016 election that Russia had hacked and shared Democratic emails, as well as reports that Trump associates were in contact with Moscow during the campaign. Trump has denied that he had any collusions with Russia.

## Key Observations

- Base models provide raw text completion
- Instruct models are better at following instructions
- Fine-tuned models excel in specialized domains
- All models are free and run locally
- **Performance:** dialogpt-small was the fastest, generating response in 0.19s
- **Base models:** May provide less structured responses as they're optimized for text completion rather than instruction following
- **Instruct models:** Generally provide more coherent and instruction-aware responses
- **Fine-tuned models:** Show specialized knowledge in their domain but may be less versatile for general queries
- **Cost:** All models used are completely free and run locally using HuggingFace transformers
