## Key Observations

- Base models provide raw text completion
- Instruct models are better at following instructions
- Fine-tuned models excel in specialized domains
- All models are free and run locally
- **Performance:** dialogpt-small was the fastest, generating response in 0.1s
- **Base models:** May provide less structured responses as they're optimized for text completion rather than instruction following
- **Instruct models:** Generally provide more coherent and instruction-aware responses
- **Fine-tuned models:** Show specialized knowledge in their domain but may be less versatile for general queries
- **Cost:** All models used are completely free and run locally using HuggingFace transformers
