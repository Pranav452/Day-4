## 🎯 How to Use My Application

### Step 1: Upload an Image
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag an image file onto the upload area
- **Browse Files**: Click to select an image from your computer
- **Use URL**: Switch to URL mode and paste an image link

### Step 2: Ask Questions
I've implemented smart auto-complete that suggests questions as you type:
- "What objects are in this image?"
- "Describe the scene in detail"
- "What text can you see?"
- "What colors are most prominent?"
- "Count the number of people"

### Step 3: Get AI Insights
My application provides detailed, intelligent responses about your image content instantly!

## 🔥 **Auto-Complete Feature**

I built an advanced auto-complete system that:
- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware question completions
- **Real-time**: Responds in under 300ms as you type
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use ↑↓ to navigate, Tab/Enter to select
- **Pattern Matching**: Intelligent suggestions based on common image analysis patterns

### How I Built It:
```typescript
// Smart pattern matching system I designed
const patterns = {
  'what': ['What objects are in this image?', ...],
  'describe': ['Describe the scene in detail', ...],
  'count': ['Count the number of people', ...]
};
```

## 📊 Test Examples I Recommend

### Example 1: **Product Analysis**
- **Image**: Photo of a smartphone
- **Question**: "What are the key features visible in this phone?"
- **My AI Response**: Detailed description of visible features, brand, model characteristics

### Example 2: **Document Reading**
- **Image**: Screenshot of a restaurant menu
- **Question**: "What's the most expensive dish and its price?"
- **My AI Response**: Accurate text extraction with specific pricing information

### Example 3: **Scene Understanding**
- **Image**: Outdoor landscape photo
- **Question**: "Describe the weather conditions and time of day"
- **My AI Response**: Analysis of lighting, shadows, sky conditions, and environmental details
